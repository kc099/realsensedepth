# Wheel Measurement System Modularization Plan

## New Module Structure

1. wheel_main.py
   - Main entry point
   - GUI setup and tkinter components
   - Event handling

2. camera_streams.py
   - RealSense camera streaming
   - Top camera streaming (event camera)
   - Side camera streaming (if not RealSense)
   - Camera initialization and cleanup

3. image_processing.py
   - Image detection and measurement algorithms
   - Wheel dimension calculations
   - Mask generation and processing

4. wheel_measurements.py
   - Calculation of real-world dimensions
   - Height/diameter measurements
   - Wheel classification

5. settings_manager.py
   - Settings loading/saving
   - Model parameters

6. utils.py
   - Shared utility functions
   - Image manipulation helpers
   - UI update helpers

7. database.py (already exists)
   - Database operations
   
8. signal_handler.py
   - 24V signal detection
   - Signal processing

9. reports_window.py (already exists)
   - Reporting interface
   
10. settings_window.py (already exists)
    - Settings interface

 ##the file wheel_main.py is an application that can measure dimensions of an object using real sense camera and standard perspective 
## projection principles. the side camera is realsense and calculates depth and distance between two points on a 
## detected segment of an object. The top camera should use standard perspective projection. the heigh to the base is 
## constant and side height is calculated by realsense, the top camera is just an event camera takes RGB image, uses intriscic
 ## calibrated matrix and depth calculated as base distance - sideheight. and projects points into camera space and calulated 
##  euclidena distance between center and a point on circumference on detected circle. This must be the calculation logic. 
##  all of this is triggered upon receving a frame from serial which is named as 24V signal. go through the code and identify
##   discrepencies with this logic in the implementation. especially want to look at athe computation logic of dimension
##    calculation of top camera. help me understand the discrepancies
